YOUR WORK:

You will complete the function setup_main_stack below. Missing code
and calculations are expressed with a questionmark (?). The
assignment is mostly about doing the correct math. To do that math
you will need to learn or understand:

- How the stack is used during program execution
- How the stack is expected to look like at start of a C-program
- What a pointer variable is, how it is used
- How a C-array (pointer to many) is laid-out in memory
- How pointer arithmetic behaves
- How to cast from one pointer type to another
- How to use printf to print good debug information
- How to use a C-struct, both object and pointer to

Some manual-pages of interest:

man -s3 printf
man -s3 strlen
man -s3 strncpy
man -s3 strtok_r

The prototype for above functions:

int printf(const char *restrict format, ...);
size_t strlen(const char *s);
size_t strncpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t dstsize);
char *strtok_r(char *s1, const char *s2, char **lasts);

The above functions exist in Pintos code. Note the Pintos use
'strlcpy' instead of 'strncpy'. If 'dst' is large enough they behave
identical. You can find Pintos implementations in
/home/TDIU16/labs/skel/pintos/src/lib, see string.c and stdio.c. It
is strongly recommendable to look at the strtok_r examples given in
string.c
